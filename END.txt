BY    late    accounts    from    Rotterdam,    that    city    seems    to    be    in    a    high    state    of    philosophical    excitement.
Indeed,    phenomena    have    there    occurred    of    a    nature    so    completely    unexpected—so    entirely    novel—so
utterly    at    variance    with    preconceived    opinions—as    to    leave    no    doubt    on    my    mind    that    long    ere    this    all
Europe    is    in    an    uproar,    all    physics    in    a    ferment,    all    reason    and    astronomy    together    by    the    ears.
It    appears    that    on    the——    day    of——    (I    am    not    positive    about    the    date),    a    vast    crowd    of    people,
for    purposes    not    specifically    mentioned,    were    assembled    in    the    great    square    of    the    Exchange    in    the
well-conditioned    city    of    Rotterdam.    The    day    was    warm—unusually    so    for    the    season—there    was
hardly    a    breath    of    air    stirring;    and    the    multitude    were    in    no    bad    humor    at    being    now    and    then
besprinkled    with    friendly    showers    of    momentary    duration,    that    fell    from    large    white    masses    of    cloud
which    chequered    in    a    fitful    manner    the    blue    vault    of    the    firmament.    Nevertheless,    about    noon,    a    slight
but    remarkable    agitation    became    apparent    in    the    assembly:    the    clattering    of    ten    thousand    tongues
succeeded;    and,    in    an    instant    afterward,    ten    thousand    faces    were    upturned    toward    the    heavens,    ten
thousand    pipes    descended    simultaneously    from    the    corners    of    ten    thousand    mouths,    and    a    shout,    which
could    be    compared    to    nothing    but    the    roaring    of    Niagara,    resounded    long,    loudly,    and    furiously,
through    all    the    environs    of    Rotterdam.
